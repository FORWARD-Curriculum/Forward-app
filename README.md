## Testing
### Docker
If you have Docker installed on your system, a system agnostic testing environment is available by running:
`docker build -t forward-app . && docker run -p 8000:8000 -p 5173:5173 forward-app`, or if on a UNIX based system: `./run.sh`

This docker container will automatically run a development build of the full-scale app with all files as they are at the time of running. Use `^C` (Ctrl-C) to exit the container.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Any data action taken within the context of the container, such as user registration / lesson progress, is volatile and will not be saved.
