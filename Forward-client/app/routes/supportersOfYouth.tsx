                <h4>Facilitating Opportunities for Reentry, Workforce, and Academic Readiness for Youth with Disabilities in Juvenile Justice</h4>
                
                <br/>

                <p>FORWARD is a web-based transition curriculum designed to support youth with disabilities in juvenile justice and other alternative education settings as they prepare for life beyond high school. 
                    Whether you're a parent, caregiver, educator, mental health provider, probation officer, mentor, or other another type of youth supporter, your role in supporting young people during key transitions 
                    is essential — and FORWARD was developed with that in mind.

                <h3> Why FORWARD?</h3>

                <br/>

                <p>FORWARD builds on several existing, research-informed transition curricula (e.g., INSITE, RISE, RAISE, Merging Two Worlds) 
                    and was designed in response to persistent challenges observed in juvenile justice and alternative education settings. 
                    These include limited instructional time, variability in youth participation, and difficulties delivering the most relevant content 
                    before a young person exits a program.
                </p>

                <br/>

                <p>FORWARD addresses these issues by offering:</p>

                <div className="markdown">
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Flexible, web-based content</b> that youth can access during and after placement</li>
                        <li><b>Lessons that stand alone</b>, allowing youth to begin with whichever topic is most relevant to them</li>
                        <li><b>Universal Design for Transition (UDT)</b> as a guiding framework to ensure cultural responsiveness, accessibility, and multiple means of engagement</li>
                        <li><b>Accessibility features</b> including text-to-speech, closed captions, visual supports, speech-to-text responses, and simplified language at a 5th grade reading level</li>
                    </ul>

                <h3>What Does FORWARD Teach?</h3>
                <br/>

                <p>FORWARD helps youth develop practical knowledge and skills across three key areas of transition:</p>

                <div className="markdown">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Academic Readiness – Preparing for postsecondary education, including college, trade school, or GED programs</li>
                        <li>Workforce Readiness – Building job-seeking and workplace communication skills</li>
                        <li>Independent Living Readiness – Managing responsibilities like budgeting, housing, and transportation</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>The curriculum includes five core lessons:</p>

                <div className="markdown">
                    <ol>
                        <li></li>
                        <li></li>
                        <li></li>
                        <li></li>
                        <li></li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
