/**
 * Returns a the outut of a `useState<T>()` to be used on for reactive, managed response
 * state. Automatically saves the response data to the Redux Store/Backend when the component
 * is unmounted, or when `saveResponse()` is called.
 *
 * @param type - Type of the activity to know what reponse goes where.
 * @param activity - The activity object to retrieve id from.
 * @param trackTime - Used in Higher Order Activites (Quiz, Poll) to indicate that time
 * should not be tracked as a whole, but instead is the aggregate of the children's times.
 * This is important to ensure that the unmounting of the parent, which if true calls the
 * `resetTimeSpent()`, and thus tracked time would be inacurate for children.
 * @param initialFields - Due to the nature of generics, the only fields we can guarantee on
 * an initialize are those from the LCD response type {@link BaseResponse}, and so to not have
 * undefined fields can populate them on creation.
 * @param nonRootActivity - Used to indicate that this is a non-root activity, and thus, should not
 * be saved as the "current" response, which is used to lock progress on the lesson.
 * @returns `[response, setResponse, saveResponse] as const`
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 *  const [response, setResponse, saveResponse] = useResponse<QuestionResponse, Question>("Quiz", quiz, false, { highestQuestionReached: 0 });
 *  //...
 *    onClick={()=>setResponse({...response, highestQuestionReached: response.highestQuestionReached + 1})};
 *  //...
 * ```
