## Common Fields

All content types (TextContent, VideoContent, Quiz, Poll, WritingActivity) share these base fields:
- `id`: Primary key identifier
- `lesson_id`: Foreign key to parent lesson
- `title`: Display title of the content
- `order`: Position within the lesson
- `created_at`: Timestamp of creation
- `updated_at`: Timestamp of last update

## Relationships

1. Lesson to Content Types
    - One-to-many relationship with all content types
    - Content types are ordered within their lesson
    - Each content type can belong to only one lesson

2. Quiz and Poll to Questions
    - One-to-many relationship
    - Questions are ordered within their parent
    - Questions cannot exist without a parent

3. VideoContent to MediaAsset
    - One-to-many relationship
    - MediaAssets are specifically tied to video content
    - Handles technical metadata for video files
