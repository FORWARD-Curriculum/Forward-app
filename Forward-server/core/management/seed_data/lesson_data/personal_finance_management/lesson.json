If not enough was taken out, you may need to pay the difference. Filing on time helps you avoid problems later and makes sure you get any money back that's owed to you.\n\nWhen you file taxes, you have a few options:\n\n* **File online:** There are many companies that provide guidance on filing taxes by yourself through an online service, such as H\\&R Block or TurboTax. The IRS itself has began offering this service for free in some situations. These services help you know what to fill out and catch errors as you go. This option can be free or can cost a small fee and is the easiest way to file taxes on your own.   \n* **File with a tax preparer:** There are many companies and certified tax preparers who can help you with your forms and submitting your taxes. This option may cost a bit of money but is a great option for individuals who own their own business or have complicated tax situations.  \n* **File manually by yourself:** for this option you complete a 1040 and other documents and submit them online or by mail to the IRS.

      "content": "One way to be prepared for debt, unexpected expenses, and larger purchases is by developing savings. In addition to checking and credit accounts, you can open savings accounts with your bank. Savings accounts do not come with a debit or credit card, but instead are there to hold money that you would like to try to avoid spending--at least for now. Like credit accounts, savings accounts typically gain <def def='Extra money charged when borrowing money or earned when saving money.'>interest</def> but unlike credit, this interest is not a charge to your account. Instead it is additional money that the bank gives to your account as a benefit to keeping money saved with them. Although this interest is typically a small amount, it can add up over time and make a difference.\n\nIt's a good idea to save a bit of money from every paycheck you receive and avoid taking money out of your savings account as much as you can. Interest gained on savings depends on how much money is in your account already so the more you save, the more you will gain!\n\nSome banks also have programs to help you save money as you spend money. For example, you may have the option to automatically <def def=\"Moving money from one place to another, like sending money from your checking account to your savings account, or from your bank to someone else's bank.\">transfer</def> money from your checking account to your savings account every time you make a <def def='Any action that changes the money in your account--like a deposit, withdrawal, transfer, or a purchase with your debit card.'>transaction</def>."

Experts usually recommend a 3-6 month emergency fund that is equal to your expenses for that time. That way, if something happens like losing your job, you are prepared financially while you look for something new.\n\n**Large purchases:** If you are planning on making large purchases, such as buying furniture, electronics, or appliances, it's a good idea to set aside money for at least a few months in preparation. The amount you save will probably depend on how much the item costs, but it's a good rule to wait to buy something until you can afford to buy it twice without going into debt. With purchases like this, you may want to use your credit card and then pay off your credit card with your savings in the next month--this can help build your credit.\n\n**Events and travel:** Special events in your own life, like a wedding or having a baby, are certainly things that you should prepare for by saving money. Events such as these often have many unexpected costs or may be more expensive than expected. Vacations and travel also require some planning and are something you should prepare for financially in advance. Don't forget that with each of these, you will likely be taking time off of work, which may mean that not only are you spending more money, but you are also making less money than you typically would.\n\n**Down payments:** A down payment is money that is needed when you take out a loan for a large purchase, like with a car or a house. This is money you will put toward the purchase right away before you receive the loan. A down payment should be around 10% of the cost, but the more you are able to put down, the better. Putting down more money will mean a lower monthly payment and possibly a better interest rate."

These steps prepare you for when you do have income.\n\nHere are some examples of financial goals you could set, even if you don't have money right now:\n\n- \"I will keep track of things I would spend on if I had cash, and notice which ones are needs vs. wants.\"\n- \"I will practice planning how I would use $20 in three different ways.\"\n- \"I will spend 10 minutes a week practicing how to fill out a budget sheet.\"\n- \"I will talk to a trusted adult about one financial question I have.\"\n\nThink about a habit or practice you can work on now that connects to personal finance.\nExample: \"I will write down three money choices I might face after release and how I would handle them.\"\n\nOnce you have identified a habit or practice, turn that practice into a process goal you can try each week.\nExample: \"I will practice making a weekly budget plan, even without money, so I'm ready when I have income.\"",
