They're not just for work--you'll use them in school, with friends, and in everyday life. Employers often say they care more about soft skills than job knowledge. Why? Because they can train you on the tasks of a job, but how you show up, interact, and handle challenges is up to you.\n\n <br> In this lesson, we'll focus on several categories of soft skills. We'll break them down one by one, and you can always come back later to review or see how much you've grown."

Email etiquette is important because it helps you make a good first impression. You'll use it in many situations--like applying for a job, asking about a scholarship, or communicating with teachers, supervisors, and coworkers.\n\n <br> So what does good email etiquette look like?\n\n* **Start with a greeting.** Examples: \"Dear,\" \"Good morning,\" or \"Hello.\"  \n* **Write a clear subject line.** This should say what your email is about. Keep it short and direct.  \n  * Example: If you need to make up a test, write \"Make up test Friday.\" If you are writing about a job interview, write \"Interview for job position.\"  \n* **Keep the main message simple and professional.** Be respectful, avoid slang, and check your spelling and punctuation.  \n* **End with a closing.** Examples: \"Sincerely,\" \"Thank you,\" or \"Best.\""

Good phone etiquette shows respect, helps you come across as professional, and makes conversations smoother.\n\n#### **Communicating Over the Phone**\n\n* Try to pick up within the first 2-3 rings.  \n* Have a professional voicemail set up so callers can leave a message.  \n* Start by identifying yourself (\"Hi, this is Jordan\").  \n* Since people can't see your face, your tone matters--sound positive, not bored or harsh.  \n* Move to a quiet area to cut down on background noise.  \n* Listen closely and stay focused during the call.  \n* Keep the conversation clear and to the point--avoid going off track.  \n* End the call politely, making sure everything was covered.\n\n#### **When and How to Use Your Phone**\n\nPhones can also be a big distraction if used at the wrong time. To keep things professional at work and school:\n\n* Use your phone mostly during breaks, unless it's an emergency.  \n* Put your phone on silent or \"Do Not Disturb\" during class or work hours.  \n* Step into a private spot if you need to take a call.  \n* Follow school or workplace phone rules, since every place may have different expectations."

This skill helps you solve problems, avoid mistakes, and make choices that make sense--not just ones based on emotion or habit.\n\n <br> Critical thinking is closely connected to problem solving--but they're not exactly the same. Critical thinking is about *how* you think, while problem solving is about *what* you do with that thinking.\n\n <br> For example, if you're stuck on your homework, critical thinking helps you figure out *why*--maybe you missed a key step, don't understand the directions, or need to review your notes.\n\n <br> Then problem solving comes in as you decide *what to do next*, like re-reading the question, finding examples online, asking a classmate, or emailing your teacher.
