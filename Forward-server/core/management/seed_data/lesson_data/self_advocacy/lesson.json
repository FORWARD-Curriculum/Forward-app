      "content": "Self-advocacy means understanding your needs, knowing your rights, and speaking up for yourself in a respectful way. It's about making sure your voice is heard when decisions are being made about your life--whether that's in school, at work, or in your personal life. Everyone has the right to share their opinions and ask for support, and self-advocacy is the skill that helps you do that.\n\nWhen you practice self-advocacy, you're building confidence and independence. It can look like asking a teacher for extra help on an assignment, telling an employer when you need clear instructions, or letting people know what goals you're working toward. It doesn't mean you have to do everything alone--it means you take an active role in shaping your future.\n\nLearning to self-advocate helps you prepare for life after school or treatment programs. The more you practice, the stronger you'll get at identifying what matters to you and finding the words to share it. Over time, this skill can help you build better relationships, stay on track with your goals, and make sure your needs are respected.",

      "content": "Everyone has strengths--skills, qualities, or ways of thinking that help them succeed in different areas of life. Strengths can show up in many forms, such as being a good listener, staying organized, working well with others, or finding creative solutions to problems. Sometimes strengths are easy to spot, but other times they are harder to see in ourselves until we take time to reflect.\n\nRecognizing your strengths is an important step in self-advocacy. When you know what you are good at, you can use those strengths to support your goals and speak up for yourself. For example, if you are good at organizing, you might ask your employer to consider you when they are assigning tasks related to organization. If you know you learn best with step-by-step instructions, you can advocate for yourself by asking a teacher or supervisor to explain tasks in that way.\n\nExplore the map below to learn more about Personal, <def def='Working and getting along with other people, like listening, talking, helping, or being part of a team.'>Interpersonal</def>, and <def def='Thinking and learning processes, like remembering, paying attention, solving problems, or making choices.'>Cognitive</def> strengths.",

Self-advocacy is all about building on your strengths and working around your challenges to address specific problems. For example, if one challenge you face is not having reliable transportation to work or school, you can self-advocate to solve this, and you might use strengths such as being a planner or being creative to help you.\n\nAnother thing to learn about self-advocacy is *who* to talk to when you are addressing a problem or asking for a need to be met. Though some people may be able to offer good advice in a situation, only some people will be in the correct position to help. For example, a coworker might be a great listener about a problem at work, but if you need a work accommodation it would be best to speak to a supervisor.",
