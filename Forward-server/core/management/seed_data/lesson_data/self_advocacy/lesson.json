      "content": "Self-advocacy means understanding your needs, knowing your rights, and speaking up for yourself in a respectful way. It's about making sure your voice is heard when decisions are being made about your life--whether that's in school, at work, or in your personal life. Everyone has the right to share their opinions and ask for support, and self-advocacy is the skill that helps you do that.\n\nWhen you practice self-advocacy, you're building confidence and independence. It can look like asking a teacher for extra help on an assignment, telling an employer when you need clear instructions, or letting people know what goals you're working toward. It doesn't mean you have to do everything alone--it means you take an active role in shaping your future.\n\nLearning to self-advocate helps you prepare for life after school or treatment programs. The more you practice, the stronger you'll get at identifying what matters to you and finding the words to share it. Over time, this skill can help you build better relationships, stay on track with your goals, and make sure your needs are respected."

      "content": "Everyone has strengths—-skills, qualities, or ways of thinking that help them succeed in different areas of life. Strengths can show up in many forms, such as being a good listener, staying organized, working well with others, or finding creative solutions to problems. Sometimes strengths are easy to spot, but other times they are harder to see in ourselves until we take time to reflect. \n\n Recognizing your strengths is an important step in self-advocacy. When you know what you are good at, you can use those strengths to support your goals and speak up for yourself. For example, if you are good at organizing, you might ask your employer to consider you when they are assigning tasks related to organization. If you know you learn best with step-by-step instructions, you can advocate for yourself by asking a teacher or supervisor to explain tasks in that way. \n\n Here are some strengths that you may have.

Though some people may be able to offer good advice in a situation, only some people will be in the correct position to help. For example, a coworker might be a great listener about a problem at work, but if you need a work accommodation it would be best to speak to a supervisor.\n\nWith each question below, fill in the blank with someone who you would talk to in order to advocate for yourself in the scenario.",
