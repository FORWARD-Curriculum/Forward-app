Body language also matters--professional communication often includes making eye contact, nodding to show understanding, and keeping posture open and attentive.\n\n![Professional communication](professional.jpg)\n\nProfessional communication uses polite and complete language. This might mean speaking in full sentences instead of short phrases, avoiding curses, and choosing words that are respectful. Tone is often steady and polite, rather than sarcastic or overly relaxed. Body language that supports professionalism includes a firm handshake, standing or sitting upright, and not fidgeting while someone else is speaking. These details show that you are serious, reliable, and capable of handling responsibility.\n\n<def def='Doing something on purpose, with thought and intention, instead of by accident.'>Deliberately</def>"

Strong written communication means using clear words, correct spelling, and an appropriate tone depending on who will read it. For example, the way you write to a teacher or employer should look more professional than how you text a close friend. Practicing written communication helps you express your thoughts clearly, build stronger relationships, and show responsibility in school, work, and daily life.\n\nIn this activity, you will practice your written communication by drafting a cover letter for a job.

With friends, our words help us tell stories, laugh, and share how we feel. No matter the situation, spoken words are one of the easiest ways to communicate.\n\nNon-verbal communication is the way we send messages without using words. This includes our facial expressions, <def def='Hand and body movements that help to communicate. For example, a shrug or pointing.'>gestures</def>, body posture, and even the tone of our voice. These signals can show feelings or add meaning to what we say. In professional settings, good non-verbal communication can show confidence, respect, and attention.

      "content": "Every time we communicate, we're talking to an audience -- whether that's one person, a group of people, or even ourselves. Our audience shapes the words we choose, the details we share, and even the tone of our voice. Talking to a teacher often looks different than talking to a sibling, and the way we tell a story to a boss may not be the same way we'd share it with a best friend. Being aware of our audience helps us make choices about what to say, how much to share, and how to say it respectfully.\n\nChanging communication for different audiences doesn't mean being fake. Instead, it shows that we understand the situation and the relationship. For example, using casual language with a friend can help us connect, while using more professional language with an employer shows responsibility. Thinking about audience is part of being an effective communicator because it helps our message land in the way we intend.",

For example, telling a friend what you ate for lunch might be fine, but telling a teacher all the details about your crush or relationship probably isn't the right time or place. Oversharing can make other people feel uncomfortable, or it can lead to people knowing things about you that you don't want shared. It's important to think about who your audience is, what your relationship with them is like, and whether the details you want to share are necessary for the conversation.\n\nLearning to recognize and avoid oversharing is a useful skill for both personal and professional situations. On the job, it shows maturity when you can keep conversations friendly but focused without spilling too much private information. With friends and family, it helps you set healthy boundaries and protect your privacy. Remember, you're in control of how much you share about your life, and it's okay to keep some things just for yourself.",

Sometimes we hold details about friends, family, or classmates that may feel important in the moment, but those details belong to them, not us.

When deciding whether to disclose something, pause and ask yourself: *Is this my story to tell?*\n\nIt's also worth remembering that even information about yourself can affect others. For example, if you talk about something that happened at home, it may also reveal things about your family that they might not want shared.

      "content": "In the workplace, disclosure can take on a very specific meaning: sharing information about a criminal history with an employer. Just like with other kinds of personal information, the key is balancing what is appropriate for the situation and who you are sharing with. Employers expect honesty. If a background check is part of the hiring process, being upfront about criminal history can show responsibility and build trust. At the same time, not every detail of your past is always relevant or necessary to share.\n\nWhen we talk about criminal history, it's important to understand what that actually means. A criminal history is a record of a person's involvement with the legal system, but not all involvement is the same.\n\nHaving a criminal history does not stop someone from getting a job. However, the type of criminal history may put limits on what type of job someone might get. For example, an employer may not want to hire someone to handle their finances if that person has a history of stealing money from a past employer. Or, someone who has a history of violence might not be allowed to work with children. These limits can be set by the state, or may be the preference of the employer.\n\nHere's a snapshot of what some Arizona employers said when they were asked about hiring someone with a criminal record.\n\nEmployers in Arizona were asked if they would interview someone who had **a non-violent offense.**\n\n![Employers Non-Violent Offense](employers4.png)\n\nEmployers in Arizona were asked if they would interview someone with **a violent offense.**\n\n![Employers Violent Offense](employers5.png)",

Effective questions are open-ended, thoughtful, and specific. Instead of yes/no responses, they encourage others to share ideas, explain reasoning, or connect personally. To ask effectively: (1) be clear about what you want to understand, (2) phrase your question in a way that invites more than one-word answers, and (3) listen closely so you can build on what the other person says. Strong questions build trust, improve problem-solving, and help you understand situations in school, work, and everyday life.\n\n**Instead of asking:** *\"Is this going to be on the test?\"* **You might ask:** *\"Can you explain how this connects to what we learned last week?\"*\n\n![On the Test](on_the_test.jpg)\n\n**Instead of asking:** *\"Do I have to do it this way?\"* **You might ask:** *\"What's the goal for this project, and are there other ways I could reach it?\"*\n\n![Work in Kitchen](work_in_kitchen.jpg)\n\n**Instead of asking:** *\"Why are you mad?\"* **You might ask:** *\"I notice you seem upset--do you want to talk about what's on your mind?\"*\n\n![Couple Fighting](couple_fighting.jpg)\n\nEach sentence below is missing the best way to phrase a question.
